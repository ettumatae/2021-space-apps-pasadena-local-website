### 5) Run spaceapps-pasadena:

Start the server. Run `npm start` and open http://localhost:8080 to view the
site in a browser. <br>

You should see the website.

<br>

### 6) View your updates:

View updates in your browser by opening a new terminal tab (command/ctrl t).
<br>
Make sure you're in the spaceapps-pasadena folder <br>

```
npm run watch
```

Wait a few seconds, and refresh your browser page. You should see the updates.
Note: Every update you make should be auto-updated. If there are issues, check
your terminal for errors.

Open the terminal that has your server running, and close the server with

```
ctrl + c
